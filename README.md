# Auto-Suggest

An auto-suggestion project that provides real-time suggestions as users type in a search bar. This implementation includes a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript setup for demonstrating the auto-suggest functionality with sample data.

## Project Structure

- **maiin.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage for displaying auto-suggestions.

- **java.js**: JavaScript file that handles the logic for fetching and displaying suggestions based on user input.
- **data.json**: Sample data file containing suggestions for the auto-suggest functionality.

## Features

- **Real-Time Suggestions**: As the user types, the system provides suggestions based on the input.
- **JSON Data Source**: Utilizes a JSON file to load data and simulate an auto-suggestion feature.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and straightforward design for easy integration and customization.

## How to Run

1. Open `maiin.html` in any web browser.
2. Start typing in the input field to see suggestions based on the sample data provided in `data.json`.

## Customization

- **Data Source**: Modify `data.json` to include your own set of suggestions.
- **Styles**: Update `body.css` to change the appearance of the suggestion dropdown.
- **Logic**: Adjust `java.js` for advanced filtering or additional features as needed.
